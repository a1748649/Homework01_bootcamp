        <p> Learn2Code is a 1-on-1 tuition course for grade school kids to learn some basic programming!
            Within the course, students will use the C++ language to come up with formatted and easy to
            understand solutions to basic problems, and build up our skills to more complex situations </p>

            <H4>Why start so young?</H4>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Young brains have high neural plasticity. This means they are great at learning new things!</li>
                    <li> Good mental excercise! The brain needs constant load training, the more the better for healthy brain development </li>
                    <li> The future is coding, it pays as one of the highest grad salleries of all entry level jobs available</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                <H2> FAQ's...</H2>
                <H4> How do you make computer coding accessible for me/my child?</H4>
                <p> We start at the very basics, using something called the Terminal to navigate and make a folder (just like using finder on mac, or windows document finder). Using this tool, and my guidence, we can compile and run code as well as make folders, navigate, and create new coding documents
                    We write the code in a 'text-editor' called sublime. Very easy to use, and nicely color coordinated to help reduce confusion. Using these tools,
                    we can build some basic addition calculators. Slowekly but surely, we build up complexity until we can use functions (tools to do our heavy lifting) addition
                    and control statements.
                </p>

                <H4> Is it affordable? </H4>
                <p> Yes! Only being 20-30 minute lessons (based on lesson load and student focus) at 10$ per 10 mins, it can be as little as $20 per week to
                    learn how to code at your pace!
                </p>

                <H4> Where are lessons held? </H4>
                <p> Wherever you want! I come to you, with a whiteboard + stand and my Mac computer we can work on</p>

                <H4> When can i start?</H4>
                <p> Spaces are limited, call/text or email me using the contact details to the right</p>

                <H4> Did you build this website yourself?</H4>
                <p> You are certainly right! Using the course from C++, even you can begin to understand how to write/publish your own websites on the internet. </p>
